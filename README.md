# 🧭 Spots App – React Version (AltSchool Assignment) 2nd semester.

This is my personal React version of the **Spots App**, created for an individual assignment at **AltSchool Africa – School of Engineering**.  
It’s a solo rebuild of a group project we did earlier, now built completely with **React**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This app was part of my task to turn a group-built HTML/JS app into a **React project**.  
It shows my skills in:

- Rewriting and organizing code
- Building with components and React Hooks
- Making the UI interactive and saving data locally

---

## 📱 What the App Does

The Spots App is a simple social app where you can:

- ✏️ Edit your profile (with image)
- 🖼️ Create posts (image + title)
- ❤️ Like/unlike posts
- 🔍 Preview post images
- 💾 Keep your data after refresh (using local storage)

Everything is responsive and built using React.
