#  Spots App – React Version (AltSchool Assignment) 2nd semester.

This is my personal React version of the **Spots App**, created for an individual assignment at **AltSchool Africa – School of Engineering**.  
It’s a solo rebuild of a group project we did earlier, now built completely with **React**.

---

##  Purpose

This app was part of my task to turn a group-built HTML/JS app into a **React project**.  
It shows my skills in:

- Rewriting and organizing code
- Building with components and React Hooks
- Making the UI interactive and saving data locally

---

##  What the App Does

The Spots App is a simple social app where you can:

-  Edit your profile (with image)
-  Create posts (image + title)
-  Like/unlike posts
-  Preview post images
-  Keep your data after refresh (using local storage)

Everything is responsive and built using React.

##  Tech Used

- [x] **React** (Hooks + Components)  
- [x] **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- [x] **HTML5 & CSS3**
