# Spots App – React Conversion (AltSchool Africa Assignment)

Welcome to my **React-based personal version of the Spots App** – a conversion assignment for the AltSchool Africa School of Engineering.  
This project builds upon an earlier group assignment, reimagined and implemented individually in React as instructed by my instructor at AltSchool.

---

## Purpose

This project was created as part of an individual assignment to convert the collaborative group project (**Spots App**) into a React-based application.  
It demonstrates my ability to refactor, modularize, and enhance a previously JavaScript/HTML/CSS project using React, focusing on state management, component architecture, and persistent UI interactivity.

---

## Project Overview

**Spots App** is a responsive social interface inspired by a Figma design, featuring:

- **Profile editing** (with image upload)
- **Creating new posts** (image + title)
- **Post interaction** (like/unlike)
- **Image preview modal**
- **Persistent data** (across reloads)

This version is fully built with React and leverages hooks for state, effects, and DOM interactions.  
All functionality is modularized into reusable components.

## Tech Stack

- [x] React (Functional Components, Hooks)
- [x] JavaScript (ES6+)
- [x] HTML5 & CSS3 (for layout/styling)

## Assignment Context

This React conversion is an **individual assignment** at [AltSchool Africa, School of Engineering].  
The original Spots App was a group project completed with Circle 13 classmates.  
This repository demonstrates applying React concepts to solve real UI tasks, enhancing both my learning and portfolio.
